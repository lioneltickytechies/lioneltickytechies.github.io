        <h3>Dogs</h3>

            Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, 
            not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. 
            They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first 
            animals ever to be domesticated. There are different studies that 
            suggest that this happened between 15.000 and 100.000 years before 
            our time. The dingo is also a dog, but many dingos have become wild 
            animals again and live independently of humans in the range where 
            they occur (parts of Australia).

        <h3>Cats</h3>

            Cats, also called domestic cats (Felis catus), are small, carnivorous 
            mammals, of the family Felidae. Domestic cats are often called 
            'house cats' when kept as indoor pets. Cats have been domesticated 
            (tamed) for nearly 10,000 years. They are one of the most popular 
            pets in the world. They are kept by humans for hunting rodents and as 
            companions. There are also farm cats, which are kept on farms to keep 
            rodents away; and feral cats, which are domestic cats that live away 
            from humans.
